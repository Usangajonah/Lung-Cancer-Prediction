# LUNG CANCER PREDICTION USING LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODEL
![LungCancer1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109528502/197523521-80442bcf-37fc-44d9-9ab6-1a7d2b1738b0.jpeg)

Lung cancer is a type of cancer that begins in the lungs, it typically does not cause signs and symptoms in its earliest stages. The signs and symptoms occur mainly when the disease is advanced. The accuracy of the cancer prediction system enables the people to learn about their cancer risk at a minimal cost and it also enables them to make the best decision possible depending on the cancer risk status.

## ABOUT PROJECT
In this project, I created an algorithm using logistic Regression model in python which makes prediction to enable people know their lung cancer risk status.

## PYTHON LIBRARIES IMPORTATIONS
A library which is a collection of functions that we include in our python code and called as necessary. With libraries, pre-existing functions can be imported which will efficiently expand the code performance. For this project, I will import the following libraries pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn e.t.c. Then set %matplotlib inline since Iâ€™m using a Jupiter notebook

## GETTING DATA
I worked with the Lung Cancer csv file which can accessed here. It has categorical Customer info, such as Gender, Lung_cancer. Then it also has numerical value columns:
*  Age 
*  Smoking
*  Yellow_fingers
*  Anxiety 
*  Peer_pressure 
*  Chronic disease
*  Fatigue 
*  Allergy 
*  Wheezing 
*  Alcohol consuming 
*  Coughing 
*  Shortness of breath
*  Swallowing difficulty 
*  Chest pain
